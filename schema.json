Files may be text lists specifying coordinates or appropriate raster grid formats. When a grid is used, it must have the same cell size and extent as the resistance grid. The value stored in each grid cell location refers to the focal node ID. Cells that do not contain focal nodes should be coded with NODATA values. When a text list is used, the value field references the focal node ID.  For raster analyses, focal nodes may occur at points (single cells on the resistance grid) or across regions (Fig. 8). For the latter, a single ID would occupymore than one cell in a grid or more than one pair of coordinates in a text list (and falling within more than one cell in the underlying resistance grid). Cells within a single region would then be collapsed into a single node, as they are when short-circuit region files are used (see below). The difference is that a focal region will be 'burned in' to the resistance grid only for pairwise calculations that include that focal node. As with short-circuit regions, focal regions need not be made up of contiguous cells. For large grids or large numbers of focal nodes, focal regions may require more computation time. When calculating resistances on large raster grids and not creating voltage or current maps, focal points will run much more quickly."
